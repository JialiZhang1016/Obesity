# Obesity Dataset Analysis Project for STAT 6545

This document outlines the proposal for a data analysis project conducted as part of the requirements for STAT 6545. Below are the names of the team members who will collaboratively work on this project:

- **Jiali Zhang**
- **Maddie Perez**
- **Jarrad Botchway**

The project will involve comprehensive data analysis employing various statistical methods to extract meaningful insights and conclusions from the provided dataset. The following sections will detail the specific analyses proposed and the expected outcomes of this collaborative effort. For further details on our project's scope, methodologies, and updates, please visit our project repository on GitHub: [Obesity Project Repository](https://github.com/JialiZhang1016/Obesity/tree/main).
To directly access the dataset we are analyzing, you can visit the following link: [Obesity Dataset](https://github.com/JialiZhang1016/Obesity/blob/main/ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv).

## 1. Problem background and importance

## 2. Variables

## 3. Method

**a. Data Reduction or Structural Simplification:**

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensions, focusing on numerical variables like Age, Height, and Weight, to identify the key factors that explain the most variance. Understand which variables are the most significant in explaining obesity variations, reducing data complexity for further analysis.

**b. Grouping or Discrimination:**

Apply Cluster Analysis to group individuals based on their lifestyle and health data, identifying patterns related to obesity risk. Discover distinct lifestyle patterns that correlate with different obesity levels, offering insights for targeted health interventions.

**c. Dependence Investigation:**

Perform Correlation Analysis to identify relationships between lifestyle factors and obesity measures. Determine which lifestyle factors are closely linked to obesity, guiding preventive strategies and further research.
