# Obesity dataset

This is data analysis project for STAT 6545.

## 1. Problem background and importance

## 2. Variables

## 3. Method

**a. Data Reduction or Structural Simplification:**

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensions, focusing on numerical variables like Age, Height, and Weight, to identify the key factors that explain the most variance. Understand which variables are the most significant in explaining obesity variations, reducing data complexity for further analysis.

**b. Sorting or Grouping:**

Apply Cluster Analysis to group individuals based on their lifestyle and health data, identifying patterns related to obesity risk. Discover distinct lifestyle patterns that correlate with different obesity levels, offering insights for targeted health interventions.

**c. Dependence Investigation:**

Perform Correlation Analysis to identify relationships between lifestyle factors and obesity measures. Determine which lifestyle factors are closely linked to obesity, guiding preventive strategies and further research.
